He has also made 2 films with Rajnikant – Hum and Ghairqanooni.</p><p>In 2011 he appeared in Jagmohan Mundhra's adult comedy, Naughty @ 40. Although the film received negative reviews, Govinda's performance was appreciated. He also appeared in Rajnish Thakur's comedy, Loot, and voiced Bajrangi the monkey for Nikhil Advani's animated Delhi Safari.</p><p>In 2010 Govinda appeared in Mani Ratnam's bilingual project, Raavan, with Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai. He played a Forest Ministry employee who takes Vikram's character through the woods in search of a wanted criminal.

On 5 February 2009, Rai filed a complaint against Govinda, accusing him of assault and crime, in the Borivali Magistrate Court. In 2013, the court ruled against Rai. In 2014, Rai took his case to the Supreme Court. He said that he had come to Mumbai to become an actor, and felt very humiliated when he was slapped by Govinda. According to Rai, he had contested the case for six years and had spent ₹500,000–600,000 on attorney fees. Since the actor did not apologise, he was more determined to fight him in court. In December 2015, the Supreme Court asked Govinda to apologise to Rai for slapping him and settle the whole matter out of the court immediately in the span of two weeks. The actor said that he "respects" the court's decision, and will decide when he receives it in writing.</p><p>In 2008 Govinda appeared in Money Hai Toh Honey Hai, directed by Bollywood choreographer <a href=#>Ganesh Acharya</a>, which was a box office failure.

That year Salman Khan invited Dhawan and Govinda on his show, 10 Ka Dum, to celebrate the success of Partner.</p><p>Govinda's film-star status could explain his inaccessibility to his constituents but not his absence from parliament.

At the same time, he continued his film career while he was serving as an MP. Indeed, his career witnessed a comeback of sorts in 2007, after the release of Partner. He was pilloried in the press for the combination of continuing to act in films while being generally absent from parliament, and inaccessible to his constituents. On 20 January 2008, Govinda decided to leave politics and concentrate on his Bollywood acting career.</p><p>His first release of 2007 was director Nikhil Advani's big-budget drama, Salaam-e-Ishq: A Tribute to Love.

Although the film was a box office disappointment, Govinda's performance was praised.</p><p>Govinda made a comeback to films in late 2006 with the comedy Bhagam Bhag (directed by Priyadarshan), in which he appeared with Akshay Kumar and <a href=#>Lara Dutta</a>. It was Govinda and Kumar's first film together.</p><p>Govinda (a member of the Indian National Congress) was elected the seventh member of parliament for the Mumbai North constituency of Maharashtra, India in the 14th Lok Sabha elections in 2004, defeating Ram Naik of the Bharatiya Janata Party.</p><p>Govinda then joined the Indian National Congress. He won a seat in Parliament from Mumbai North by defeating five-time MP Ram Naik, a former Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas, by over 50,000 votes in the 2004 general election.</p><p>In 2004, Govinda joined the Congress Party and was elected to the Lok Sabha (the lower house of the Indian parliament) from Mumbai by 50,000 votes over the five-term incumbent.</p><p>The actor took a break from films during the period of 2003 to 2005. He had no new film releases in 2004 and 2005, although some of his delayed films were released during this time, (such as 2005's Khullam Khulla Pyaar Karen and Ssukh— produced by Govinda and directed by his brother, Kirti Kumar and 2006's Sandwich) which were box office failures.</p><p>After a series of several unsuccessful films in the 2000s, his later commercial successes included Bhagam Bhag (2006), Partner (2007), Life Partner (2009), and Holiday (2014) .

Main Jhuth Nahin Bolta and Akhiyon Se Goli Maare.</p><p>He played a villain for the first time in his career in Shikari (2000). Although the movie was not a commercial success, Govinda's convincing portrayal of a sociopathic murderer was critically acclaimed. He turned down roles in Taal, Gadar: Ek Prem Katha and Devdas, all of which were successful.</p><p>In 1999, Govinda was voted the world's tenth-greatest star of stage or screen in a BBC News Online poll.
