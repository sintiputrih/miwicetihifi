Bio</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><span>Flavour is a Nigerian musician, multi-instrumentalist, singer, songwriter.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The reason I decided to treat this as a topic is simply that this Phyno and Flavour hail from Anambra State.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I think Nigerians got lots of musicians who hail from the eastern state. because I know<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal> Mr P and his twin brother Rudeboy also hails from there</a>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Flavour is the son of the soil but growing up away from home could mean a different experience altogether.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></span></p><p><span>Flavour was born in 1983 precisely November 23rd which in a Christian calendar is just 7 days away. from the last month of the year which is the month of Xmas.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So, if I said Flavour grew away from home, I believe that prompts questions like Where was Flavour born?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Flavour 36 was born in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer follow external" data-wpel-link=external class=wpel-icon-right>Enugu state<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, spend most of his early life in the church learning how to play an instrument.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I mean sources tell

industry</a>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Yea Davido is probably the richest as of 2021 with Wizkid sitting a few thousand dollars behind him.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But Phyno still did well to earn

Forbes</strong> is taken from the formula net worth minus debt.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This will look something like this if I am to follow the math procedure of representing the definition of net worth.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Which is:</span></p><p><span>A net worth of any celebrity is defined as all of his assets whether gold, silver, diamond, house, landed properties or cars minus how much he or she owes as debt.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The formula would look like this!&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Net worth – Debts.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Hence Phyno net worth 2020 is

data-wpel-link=internal>the likes of Tiwa Savage</a>.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span>Although if you place Flavour on a head to head comparison with the likes of Rudeboy and Mr P. the story would probably be a lot different considering these two ranks alongside <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>top celebs like Don Jazzy</a> and Davido who currently is worth like twice what Flavour is worth.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But if you are looking at some of the names Flavour ranks higher than, then names like Tekno, Patoranking, and Mayorkun would be called.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span
