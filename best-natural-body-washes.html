Us Weekly has affiliate partnerships so we may receive compensation for some links to products and services.</i></p><p>Every other week a new study comes out about how something we eat or drink or use every day is actually harmful to our health. Bacon, wine, artificial colors or flavors, various chemical additives or preservatives… nothing is safe anymore! It’s hard to keep up with it all sometimes.</p><p>We all want to do everything we can to stay healthy and happy as long as possible. As far as genetic diseases or conditions, there’s not much preventative action we can take. However, we can control what we put into our body, whether it’s the food and beverages we consume, the makeup we wear, or the skincare products we use every day.</p><h2>How body wash can affect your health</h2><p>You might think body wash is just a soap you rub onto the surface of the skin to remove dirt. As long as you rinse it all off, it goes down the drain, not into your body, right? So why does it really matter what that body wash is made out of—as long as it gets me clean, what’s the difference?</p><p>First of all, it’s just not true that your soap or body wash completely rinses off your body. Your skin isn’t an inanimate object like sheet metal. It’s porous, like a sponge, so anything that touches the surface can penetrate the top layers and get “under your skin,” as the saying goes.</p><p>Also, your skin isn’t just a fancy bodysuit—it’s actually the largest organ of the body, with the very big job of protecting your more vulnerable insides from bacteria, viruses, and any harmful chemicals you may come into contact with over your lifetime. In fact, the skin is so important that it has the power to regenerate itself, growing new skin cells within a matter of days to replace any damaged areas.</p><p>If you don’t take care of your skin, it can become more prone to injury, and it won’t be able to do its job as well as it should. So if you’ve never given a second thought to the stuff you use to wash your body, it’s probably time to start paying attention.</p><h2>Why you should use a natural body wash</h2><p>The best way to take care of your skin, and in turn, the rest of your body, is to be mindful of all the products you use on it. Remember, anything you put on the skin can be absorbed and possibly make its way into your bloodstream, which flows throughout your entire body. Even something as simple as the shower gel you use every day can have a big impact on your overall health.</p><p>Some common ingredients in skincare products are not only harmful to your health and the environment, but they are simply unnecessary. Plant-based cleansing agents and moisturizers have been used for thousands of years as natural skincare products, and luckily many brands are still focused on utilizing them in their products to this day.</p><p>Say goodbye to phthalates, parabens and artificial fragrances, and start your day right with a more natural alternative. If you’re not sure where to begin, read on to learn about the features and benefits of the 16 best natural body washes in 2023.</p><h3>1. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Blu Atlas Body Wash</a></h3><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image12-3.png alt="Blu Atlas Body Wash" width=500 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Topping our list is Blu Atlas Body Wash, made up of 99% naturally-sourced ingredients—it’s hard to get more natural than that! The bottle may have a minimalist design, but the formula is thoughtfully crafted with healthy skin in mind. Instead of harsh sulfates, this cleanser gets its foamy lather from gentle coconut-derived emollients, which cleanse away all the dirt and impurities while leaving the skin refreshed and hydrated.</p><p>One unique natural element in Blu Atlas Body Wash is sugarcane, which gently exfoliates the skin, leaving it smooth and energized. Aloe vera is a natural moisturizer, which also contains skin-soothing antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta carotene. Green tea is an unusual ingredient to find in a body wash, but it has caffeine that helps tighten the skin, and is also an anti-inflammatory, which can soothe and reduce razor burn and other irritations..</p><h3>2. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">JASÖN Moisturizing Herbs and Shea Butter Body Wash</a></h3><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image13-3.png alt="JASÖN Moisturizing Herbs and Shea Butter Body Wash" width=500 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>JASÖN uses naturally-derived ingredients in all of its products, from skincare to toothpaste. This moisturizing body wash features a nourishing herbal blend that will awaken your senses as it cleans your body. The biodegradable product is vegan, cruelty-free, and contains no parabens, phthalates, sulfates, or petrolatum.</p><p>Shea butter provides skin-strengthening vitamins A and E, along with its natural hydration properties that keep your skin soft and supple. Also included in the formula is avocado oil, another powerful moisturizer that infuses the skin with essential fats that help hold in moisture. Sage, calendula, chamomile and other herbs provide a soothing effect and a natural herbal aroma.</p><h3>3. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Faith in Nature Seaweed and Citrus Body Wash</a></h3><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image2-3.png alt="Faith in Nature Seaweed and Citrus Body Wash" width=500 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Faith in Nature is a UK brand committed to keeping their ingredients natural and their prices affordable, giving everyone access to quality products from personal skincare to household detergents. They offer a variety of body washes, all made with 99% naturally-derived ingredients, but the Seaweed and Citrus Body Wash is our favorite.</p><p>Wild harvested seaweed provides antioxidants that nourish the skin, while lemon peel and tea tree oil add a fresh scent that awakens the senses. Sea salt has a slight exfoliating and detoxifying effect as this cleanser lathers up to wash all the dirt and pollutants from the skin. This product is also Vegan Society approved, cruelty-free and SLS free. As an added bonus, you can order in bulk, recycle or refill your own bottle after use, so if you’re looking to reduce waste, give Faith in Nature a try.</p><h3>4. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Fresh Milk Body Cleanser</a></h3><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image14-3.png alt="Fresh Milk Body Cleanser" width=500 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>What could be more natural than milk? Plant milk, that is.

Every one of the natural body washes on our list should do the job as well as the others. None of them are bad options. In the end, your decision will come down to your budget, your personal preferences, and what feels right on your skin.</p><p>Remember, your skin is the largest organ in your body, and it’s the gateway to your precious insides. As long as you treat it well, keep it hydrated, and focus on using products made with mostly naturally-derived ingredients, you can’t go wrong. Now go forth, and get your natural body wash on!</p><h2>Frequently asked questions</h2><h3>What should I look for in a natural body wash?</h3><p>The best natural body washes are those with a high percentage of naturally-derived ingredients (over 90%). If the majority of its contents come from botanical extracts, plants, fruits, and minerals, there is a much lower chance that your skin will develop a sensitivity or reaction to that product.</p><p>With chemical additives, preservatives, fragrances, or colorings, there’s always a higher chance that any of those substances could be harmful to your body with continual use over time. You may not feel the effects right away, but sometimes allergies and other skin problems can take years to develop.</p><h3>But my health is great! What’s wrong with chemicals, really?</h3><p>Even if your health isn’t affected by any of the common chemical additives in your skincare products, many of these ingredients can cause irreversible damage to the environment. After you rinse off your body wash, it goes down the drain, flowing down through your town’s water waste and eventually being released into the ground, the ocean, or other natural water sources.</p><p>Some of these are “forever chemicals,” that never break down or disintegrate, so they stay in the environment, making their way back into the bodies of animals, mixing in with plant DNA, and eventually, ending up in our community’s food or water supply. This is why it’s important to choose skincare, haircare, and household products that are biodegradable and contain as few chemical ingredients as possible.</p><h3>Are natural body washes better for sensitive skin?</h3><p>Sensitive skin is a complicated topic, so the answer to this question isn’t simple. Just as there are many causes and symptoms of sensitive skin, there are many types of ingredients that could aggravate any skin condition. In general, products that use natural ingredients are less likely to cause allergic reactions or skin sensitivities.</p><p>But the only way to know for sure if a particular product will work on your sensitive skin is to try it out yourself. Most dermatologists recommend a “patch test,” or trying out the product on a small area of your skin first. Wait at least a few hours to see how your skin reacts before using it on the rest of your body.</p><p>Read labels carefully, and make sure the product doesn’t contain any ingredients that you already know you’re sensitive or allergic to. Many common allergens come from natural sources, so if your skin is sensitive, you may want to narrow your search to body washes that are hypoallergenic, tested by dermatologists, or designed for sensitive skin.</p><h3>Are fragrances and colors always harmful?</h3><p>Not all colors and fragrances are harmful to your skin or the environment. You might not enjoy the scent of every “fragrance-free” product—that label just means there has been no additional fragrance added. It will usually still have some kind of scent, which is just a result of how the ingredients naturally smell when mixed together—not always pretty.</p><p>But one way to avoid the off-putting “unscented” smell while still using natural products is to look for those that contain naturally-derived fragrances, or those that have a nice blend of botanical extracts or essential oils that provide an aroma to your liking. Some examples of these natural scents in a body wash may include ingredients like tea tree oil, fruit extracts like lemon or orange peel, mint, rosemary, sage, or other botanical floral extracts.</p><p>In the same way, not all colors are made from artificial chemicals. Many plants and minerals can add color to a product naturally, such as berries, beta-carotene, and other plant or flower extracts. And remember, not all artificial colors or fragrances are harmful to everyone. Most people don’t have strong sensitivities to these additives in general. But if you have sensitive skin or known allergies, it’s usually best to stay away from all unnecessary additives.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKCfpXq4tdOhZK6rX6OyuL%2BOm5ysrF2jrrXB0ZqjZpqfmcZuw8Csn56rXw%3D%3D</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2fbest-natural-body-washes.html&title=The%20Best%20Natural%20Body%20Washes%20in%202023" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-natural-body-washes.html&description=The%20Best%20Natural%20Body%20Washes%20in%202023" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-natural-body-washes.html&title=The%20Best%20Natural%20Body%20Washes%20in%202023" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2fbest-natural-body-washes.html&title=The%20Best%20Natural%20Body%20Washes%20in%202023" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2fbest-natural-body-washes.html&text=The%20Best%20Natural%20Body%20Washes%20in%202023" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2fbest-natural-body-washes.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Aldo Pusey</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-04-18</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./vanessa-bryant-home-inside-kitchen-photos.html><h3>&lt;&lt; Vanessa Bryant's home is a work of art see photo</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./sam-seder-bio-wiki-age-height-wife-radio-show-msnbc-net-worth.html><h3>Sam Seder Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Wife, Radio Show, MSNBC, Net Worth >></h3></a></div></div></section></section><div></div></div></div><footer class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h sk3-margin-v-full sk3-pad-v-full"><div class="sk3-pad-h txt-center-h">©
